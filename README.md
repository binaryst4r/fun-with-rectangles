Fun with rectangles lets you add and manipulate rectangles on a canvas!

## Additional Features
- Duplicate a canvas to build off of existing layouts and save as their own.
- Much needed z-index manipulation so that you can change how the rectangles stack on each other.

Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE.

Enjoy rectangling!
